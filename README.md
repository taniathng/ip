Hannah has a ton of features for you to try!! 

- **Text-based**
- **Easy to learn**
- **FAST & SUPER FAST** to use

All you need to do is:
1. Download it from [here](https://github.com/taniathng/ip).
2. Double-click it.
3. Add your tasks.
4. Let it manage your tasks for you! 😉

### Features:
- [x] Managing ToDos
- [x] Managing Deadlines
- [ ] Managing Events
- [ ] Reminders (coming soon)

If you are a Java programmer, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the main method:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(MainApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

You can also edit your code using `inline code` like this: `TaskList.addTask()`.
